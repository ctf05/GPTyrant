Their is a parameter in TrainModel.py called "per_device_train_batch_size". If you run out of memory during training.
Lower that number. If you have extra memory, you can increase it.
The higher it is the faster the training, unless you run out of memory, then it will be very slow.

Some Texts were provided in the "Texts" folder to test training. You can add your own texts to that folder and train on them.
You may have to restart the program to see the new model.
